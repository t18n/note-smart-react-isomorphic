A mom was driving her daughter home. The daughter said out of the blue, "Mama?" 
The mom said: "Yes"
She said, "I'm the ugliest girl I know." 
The mom could not believe in what she hears. But she didn't say anything. Instead she went home made a Powerpoint presentation for her daughter. And, in that presentation, were androgynous rockstars and artists that live their truth, are probably made fun of every day of their life, and carry on, wave their flag, and inspire others.
There are Michael Jackson and David Bowie and Freddie Mercury and Annie Lennox and Prince and Janis Joplin and George Michael, Elton John and many more artists, and the daughter's eyes glazed over.
The mom then said, 'You know, I really wanna know why you feel this way about yourself.' 
The daughter said, 'Well I look like a boy,'
and the mom said, 'Well what do you think I look like?'
'Well you're beautiful.' 
'Well, thanks. But when people make fun of me, that's what they use. They say I look like a boy or I'm too masculine or I have too many opinions, my body is too strong.'
The mom said again to the daughter, 'Do you see me growing my hair?' She said, 'No, Mama.' I said, 'Do you see me changing my body?' 'No, Mama.' 'Do you see me changing the way I present myself to the world?' 'No, Mama.' 'Do you see me selling out arenas all over the world?' 'Yes, Mama.' **'OK! So, baby girl. We don't change. We take the gravel and the shell and we make a pearl. And we help other people to change so they can see more kinds of beauty.'**

The story is told by P!nk in the MTV Video Music Award ceremony about how she teach her daughter. That maybe something for us to learn as well.

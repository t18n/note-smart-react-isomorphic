It was a hot summer day, and Kaalu the crow was very thirsty. He flew here and there looking for water. He saw a pot with water. He went close to the pot Kaalu saw that there was very little water in it. Kaalu could not reach the water. 

He looked around and he saw some pebbles. He had an idea. He picked up the pebbles one by one and dropped them in to the pot. As Kaalu dropped the pebbles in to the pot the water came up, Kaalu drank the water. He flew away happily.

You see, in life, there are always obstacle that prevent you from reaching your goal, but if you don't give up, think of a solution, you will eventually achieve what you want. And that is the moral of this story

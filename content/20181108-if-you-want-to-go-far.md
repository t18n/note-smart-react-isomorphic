I heard Afrian proverb says this: “If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” 

Imagine you are building a business, and you wonder if you should have a partner or solely take care of everything. With partner or partners, there may come questions:
* What if he argue with my decisions?
  * What if he does not devote to this business?
  * What if I have to work much more than him?
Now, what if all questions are true down the road? Then you better go alone initially, establishing the foundation, hire people with skills you need and ask for partner when the company is stable. That will make your journey starts much faster. But achieving a certain business success is not everything.

We as human, according to Simon Sinek, are social animal. We are not the strongest, the fastest, yet we are the longest species that survive, that is because we know how to help and build for each others. 

There are too much things to bear in the world, even with our strongest man. That is where we need more people, to hold hand together, to continue generation after generation, term after term, sprint after sprint. A business which last long is an organization who knows how to connect people, inspire employees so they feel protected and do their best for the business.

So you want to thrive, you have to inspire the people around you to believe in you, believe in your vision and work towards that vision. 
 If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

And that is the lesson for today.
